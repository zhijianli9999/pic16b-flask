  <p>Welcome to our PIC16B example web application!</p>

  <p>This tutorial is closely based on the tutorial written by <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~egeo/">Erin George</a> in PIC16B, Spring '21. </p>

  <h2> Websites vs. Webapps </h2>

  <p>Hey, wait a minute. We already have a website that we made with Jekyll and GitHub Pages. Why are we making another one?</p>

  <p>Your Jekyll blog is an example of a <i>static</i> website. This means that it doesn't support any kinds of major <i>user interaction</i>. Folks who visit your website can't submit reviews, make database queries, receive directions between locations, or upload images. These kinds of interactions are supported only by <i>dynamic</i> webpages, which are in turn generated by <i>web applications</i>, often called "webapps." </p>

  <p>Whereas a static page is "just there" and doesn't require any computational resources after it's generated, a dynamic page (web application) requires computational horsepower in order to respond to user interactions. For this reason, creating dynamic webpages is much more complex than creating static webpages. Whereas with Jekyll we were able to achieve 90% of what we needed through Markdown, to create a web app we are going to need to dig deeper into both Python and HTML. </p>




  <h2> High-Level Components </h2>

  <p>Any individual webapp has a large number of interlocking components. That said, here's a very high-level overview of the main parts. </p>

  <h3>Code</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>The <b>back end</b> is the code that executes the main computational functionality of your app. For instance, in a map application, part of the back end would be an algorithm for determining the best route between two locations. The back end usually makes heavy use of the database.</li>
    <li>The <b>database</b> contains the information used by the app. In a map application, the database might contain tables for locations, road segments, points of interest, and so on. The database can be static, but in modern applications it's common to update the database in response to user actions. When a user submits a review, makes a friend request, or reports an incident, these might be added to the database. </li>
    <li>The <b>front end</b> contains the logic for user interactions. In a map application, for example, the front end would need to enable the user to choose starting and end points, a transportation modality, and other inputs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Infrastructure</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The <b>server</b> is the process that actually executes all our code. In the map website example, the server is responsible for actually calling Python functions in response to user inputs, and updating what's shown on the app accordingly. </li>
    <li>The <b>browser</b> is what displays our app. In this course, we won't worry much about the browser. More advanced functionalities sometimes depend on the browser used, which means that web developers might need to take into account whether the user is on Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc. </li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Python Web Frameworks</h2>

  <p>Many modern webpages require resources involving a range of software tools: JavaScript, PHP, HTML, SQL, Ruby, and so on. We'll be using a <i>Python web framework</i>, which will allow us to achieve some reasonably interesting results using just Python and a bit of HTML. If you'd like to learn more about the range of tools for web development, you may wish to consider taking PIC40A, which devotes a full quarter to such topics. </p>

  <p>Python offers a number of web frameworks. Two of the most popular options are Flask and Django.  We will be using Flask because it is simpler and easier to learn.  If you are doing a big project, you might find Django easier to manage.  Either way, the skills from one web framework are transferable to others, even though they may do things differently.</p>

  <p>A lot of the information here comes from the <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/">Flask documentation</a>, in particular the Quickstart and Tutorial sections.  You may want to give these a look if this this something you're interested in.</p>

  <h2>What We'll Cover</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>Basic back end development - how to write code that will run on your own computer or server and respond to requests and information sent from a browser</li>
      <li>Interfacing with SQLite</li>
      <li>Basic information on creating sessions</li>
      <li>Basic deployment - how to make your website available to the world</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What We Won't Cover (much)</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>Web design - how to change how your website looks visually and make it look appealing</li>
      <li>Front end development - how to write code that will run on someone else's browser</li>
      <li>Security - how to minimize the risk of information from your website being compromised, or of your website being used to inject malicious code into the computers of visitors.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I'd like to emphasize the last item about security. Once we're done with this sequence, you'll be able to build <i>fun</i> web applications and deploy them. You should absolutely <b>not</b> store any sensitive information in these applications, and you should using only well-known, secure hosting services. If you'd like to deal with any kind of secure information (user names, addresses, credit card numbers, etc) then please pursue advanced coursework devoted to web development.
